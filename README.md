# Basic Calculator with Keypad and OLED Display

## Components Needed:
- Keypad (4x4): For user input (numbers and operations).
- OLED or LCD Display: To show the input and results.
- Buzzer: Provides feedback when a key is pressed.

## Project Description:
This project is a basic calculator that performs essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a 4x4 keypad for input. The display (OLED or LCD) will dynamically show the current input as the user types and the result once the calculation is complete.

### Features:
1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:
   - Perform addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
   - Operations are triggered using mapped keys on the 4x4 keypad.

2. Real-Time Input and Display:
   - Display the current numbers and operations as the user types.
   - Update the screen with the final result once the equals (`=` or `#`) key is pressed.

3. Keypad Mapping:
   - A 4x4 keypad has 16 keys, which will be mapped as follows:
     - Numbers (0-9) for input.
     - Operators (`B for -`, `* for multiplication`, `c for clear`, `D for division`, `# for = ` , `A for addition`) for arithmetic 
4. Buzzer Feedback:
   - The buzzer provides an audible tone each time a key is pressed, enhancing user interaction.

### Suggested Key Mapping:
- Numbers: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `0`
- Operators: `A`, `B`, `*`, `D`
- Equals: `#`
- Clear: `C`
